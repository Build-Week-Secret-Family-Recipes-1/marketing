                About Mark: My name is Mark. I'm currently going through Lambda School for full-stack web development. 
                Computer programming was a no-brainer for me given my love of computers and technology. 
                Making applications and website from scratch is incredibly satisfying. 
                I look forward to a future career in the tech industry.
