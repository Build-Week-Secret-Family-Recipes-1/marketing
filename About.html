                I'm Sara, a web developer from central Massachusetts. 
                I enjoy coming up with creative solutions to solve problems, working with Python and JavaScript, and learning new programming languages. 
                When I'm not at my desk, I enjoy back country hiking and camping, and crossword puzzles.

                My name is Mark. I'm currently going through Lambda School for full-stack web development. 
                Computer programming was a no-brainer for me given my love of computers and technology. 
                Making applications and website from scratch is incredibly satisfying. 
                I look forward to a future career in the tech industry.
